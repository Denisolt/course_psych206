**Unit 6: Problem Solving, Reasoning, and Decision Making** <span
id="6"></span> 
*The final unit of this course will examine the cognitive processes of
problem solving, reasoning, and decision making.  These processes
typically involve heuristics, or rules that will not necessarily result
in the correct answer, rather than algorithms, which are rules that will
always lead to the correct answer.  Decisions are based on certain
opinions and assumptions rather than facts.  They apply previously
learned information to novel situations in the hopes of achieving a
“correct” result. You will also study examples of how these principles
have real-life implications.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately19.5 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Identify and define the types of problems which we encounter and the
    heuristics we use to move toward a desired goal.
-   Describe creative problem-solving processes.
-   Define inductive and deductive reasoning and the role of executive
    functioning in the decision-making process.
-   Describe the methodology, conclusions, and potential real-life
    implications of the newer empirical research in the area of decision
    making.
-   Identify decision-making heuristics.
