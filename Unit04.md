**Unit 4: Language, Mental Imagery, and Knowledge** <span
id="4"></span> 

 *In the previous units, you have learned about basic cognitive
processes such as attention and memory.  These processes represent the
building blocks to our more advanced cognitive abilities, which are the
focus of much of the research in cognitive psychology.  In this unit,
you will learn more about the theories and findings of such complex
tasks as mental imagery, language, knowledge, and comprehension.  What
makes these tasks complex is that they require a multitude of steps that
must be completed in a particular sequence in order for them to occur. 
For example, when reading this paragraph, your visual system must
accurately pick up the shape of the words while your brain must
interpret the words, find meaning for them, and put them together with
the previous words in the sentence to create a meaning for the entire
sentence.  A similar complex sequencing of events must occur for us to
create mental images, access and categorize knowledge, and comprehend
spoken language.  In this unit we will examine these different processes
as we seek to examine how it is we comprehend, communicate, understand,
and imagine.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 17 hours to complete.

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Compare and contrast the major theories and empirical findings
    associated with language, mental imagery, and comprehension.
-   Describe how mental imagery, language, and comprehension are
    connected to memory.
-   Identify the main areas of the brain associated with the various
    components/functions of language, knowledge, and comprehension.
