**Unit 2: Social Cognition, Motivation, and Emotion** <span
id="2"></span> 
*The last unit focused on the philosophical and historical roots of
cognitive psychology.  This next unit builds on this knowledge through
detailing a more modern perspective on cognitive psychology, which has
been influenced by cognitive neuropsychology.  This perspective draws on
the knowledge gleaned from neuroscience, a fast advancing field which
provides insight into how information is processed in the brain.  First,
you will be provided with a more modern definition of cognitive
psychology, which is based on the information processing approach.
Second, you will read about the methods, as well as associated
definitions and concepts, utilized in the field of cognitive
neuropsychology.  Your final readings will help you understand several
areas of research which are of interest to cognitive neuropsychologists,
including social cognitions, motivations, and emotions.  *

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 9 hours to complete.
