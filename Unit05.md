**Unit 5: Automaticity, Pattern Recognition, and Object Perception**
<span id="5"></span> 

*Next, you will learn about the psychological principles and empirical
findings related to automaticity and perception.  Automaticity is
defined as the degree to which a skill, process, or behavior requires
little mental effort.  In this unit, you will learn more about the
factors which impact automaticity and the pros and cons of automatic
processes. *  
  
 *One process that is considered relatively automatic, although not
simple, is that of perception.  Perception refers to the process by
which an organism perceives, organizes, and interprets sensory
information from the environment.  You will learn about the factors and
rules which influence how and what we perceive, particularly as they
relate to pattern recognition and object perception.  *

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 9 hours to complete.

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Define automaticity.
-   Describe the seminal research related to automaticity, pattern
    recognition, and object perception detailed in your readings.
-   Describe the methodology and main findings of the newer empirical
    research presented in this unit.
-   Identify the major models/theories associated with pattern
    recognition and object perception.
-   Describe the principles of pattern recognition.
