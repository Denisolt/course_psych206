**Unit 3: Attention and Memory** <span id="3"></span> 
*Attention enables us to complete specific tasks despite the millions of
stimuli that threaten to distract us at any given moment.  Think, for
example, about talking to someone at a crowded party.  Engaging in
conversation in that context may take more attention than it would in an
empty room.  This unit will first introduce you to the attention
process, explaining how the above example is possible.  This portion on
attention will also lay the foundation for you to learn about the
theories and empirical findings related to memory—a well-studied topic
in the field of cognitive psychology.  In this portion of the unit, you
will learn about distinct types of memories and the unique
processes/mechanisms which define them.   *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 20.5 hours to complete.
