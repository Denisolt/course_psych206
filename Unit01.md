**Unit 1: An Introduction to Cognitive Psychology** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Cognitive psychology is a subdiscipline in psychology that is generally
interested in looking at how sensory input is transformed into beliefs
and actions.  Cognitive psychologists are concerned with internal mental
processes and draw from a wide range of other subdisciplines of
psychology.  The history of cognitive psychology, like many other
disciplines in psychology, is rooted in philosophy, which sought to
explain the process by which the human mind transformed and used
information from the environment.  In this unit, you will (a) be
introduced to the broadest definition of cognitive psychology, (b) learn
about the theoretical assumptions undergirding this point of view, and
(c) read about the historical context out of which cognitive psychology
was born.     *

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 11 hours to complete.

-   **Reading: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy’s version of
    Professor Paul Thagard’s “Behaviorism” and the Noam Chomsky
    website’s version of Dr. Noam Chomsky’s Readings in the Psychology
    of Language: “A Review of B. F. Skinner’s Verbal Behavior”**

     Instructions: For the first reading, please click on the link above
    and read the entirety of this article, which covers subunits
    1.2.1–1.2.5.  Note that this article provides the background to
    understand the cognitive revolution which took place in reaction to
    the dominant perspective in the field at that time—that of
    behaviorism.   
        
     For the second reading, which covers subunits 1.2.6–1.2.7, please
    click on the above link and read the original text of the seminal
    article by Noam Chomsky, which was credited with starting the
    cognitive revolution.  
        
     The second reading is a longer article and it is, at times, dense
    and more difficult to follow.  Please be sure to keep in mind that
    you are looking to gather the “main points” of Chomsky’s argument
    against behaviorism.  It may be helpful for you to take notes to
    this aim while reading the article.
