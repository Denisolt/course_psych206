Course Syllabus for "PSYCH206: Cognitive Psychology"
----------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to cognitive psychology, or the study of
the ways in which we come to know about the world around us and about
one another.  While you may understand “cognition” as “thinking” or
“thoughts,” we will here use the term to refer to almost any process
that takes place within the human mind. Though cognitive psychology as a
formal branch of study has only been around since the late 1960s, it has
been studied for decades as an area of interest in psychological inquiry
and has its roots in philosophy.  In the late 1880s, for example,
Ebbinghaus conducted some of the very first scientifically based studies
of cognition when he attempted to explain the mechanism of memory. 
Memory, along with attention, perception, language, and decision making,
are amongst the most prominent issues within the broad and diverse field
of cognitive psychology.  While we could spend an entire semester
exploring just one of these issues, this course will instead provide you
with an overview of all of them and the related concepts which help
explain these issues in greater depth. In addition to these subjects, we
will examine the research on social cognition, motivation, and
emotions.  Although these topics were not historically under the
auspices of cognitive psychology, these multidisciplinary areas of
inquiry highlight the influence of cognitive neuroscience within the
field of cognitive psychology.  By examining the various theories and
empirical research associated with these areas of inquiry, we will learn
more about the prominent role experimentation has taken in cognitive
psychology.  We will also read examples of the more applied line of
research, which helps to further our understanding of how these
principles might apply to real-life situations. **** We will begin this
course by taking at look at the history of cognitive psychology and then
move to various areas of inquiry, which characterize the foundations of
cognitive psychology.  As we progress through the course, we will gather
information about the methodologies, findings, and theories associated
with cognitive psychology—a diverse and unique field of inquiry with a
rich history and forward thinking approach to empirical research.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

    areas of scientific research in cognitive psychology (e.g., models
    of memory, attention, etc.).

### Course Information

Welcome to PSYCH206.  Below, please find some general information on the
course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Helena (Mimi) Martin

**Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   PubMed Central (provides open access to a variety of journals in the
    area of science/psychology)
-   Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
-   Lerner’s TV’s version of University of Houston: Dr. Richard
    Kasschau’s Lecture Series *Introduction to Cognitive Psychology *
-   Wikibook’s *Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience*
-   Zain Books’s version of Virtual University of Pakistan’s *Cognitive
    Psychology:*
-   Oakland University: Professor Cindy Sifonis’s Cognitive Psychology
    Lecture Series

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
You will also need to complete a final exam.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **86 hours**
to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 11 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to progress through/complete
subunits 1.1  and 1.2 (a total of 6 hours) on Monday/Tuesday night;
subunit 1.3 (a total of 5 hours) on Wednesday/Thursday night; etc.
